*** HOW TO BUILD Kinect MEX ***
This folder contains source files to build mex files.

1. Start up MATLAB and open build_KinectMex.m
2. Change the path of OpenNI in build_KinectMex.m to the path where you installed OpenNI.
3. Run build_KinectMex.m, then you'll get mex files

README.txt tells details of Kinect MEX files, so that, 
we expect that you'll see README.txt and get information about Kinect MEX.

(README.txt is included in kinect-mex*.zip which is under 
https://kinect-mex.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/kinect-mex/ver**/Bin/)
